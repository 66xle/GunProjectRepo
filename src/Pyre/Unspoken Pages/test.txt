"You have walked these halls, uncovered what was hidden, and brought light to knowledge long forgotten.
 You have faced every challenge, solved every mystery, and shown patience, courage, and insight.
The library has tested you, and you have passed. You are now its keeper… its guardian… its next Librarian.
 From this day forward, the stories within these walls are entrusted to you. Protect them, learn from them, and guide those who come after.
The library is alive, but its voice can only be heard by those worthy. You have earned that voice. Welcome."
